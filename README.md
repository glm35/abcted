# branch archives/abc2seq

The goal of this branch is to keep track of the premilinary work on
abcted/abc2seq.py whose purpose was to transform a raw ABC tune into a sequence
of notes that could be played by the fluidsynth sequencer.

This code is far from finished, and it is not used.  Another approach was taken:
convert the ABC tune to play to MIDI with abc2midi, and then play the MIDI with
fluidsynth player.


# abcted
abcted is an editor to write ABC music files

abcted is work in progress. It is unusable at the moment.
